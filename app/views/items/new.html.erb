<%= concept("item/cell/new", @form) %>
<!-- to pass arguments to cell, we can append .(:show, user: current_user)
to the previous line, where :show is the method name, then follows the
arguments passed, passing current_user was useful if you need to include
user's id in the form fields, Or you can set user_id in the operation as 
implemented here (see app/concept/item/operation.rb) -->
